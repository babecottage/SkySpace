jem is an artist, musician, coach & technologist living in the redwoods in northern california

as a gemini sun & enneagram 7 with extreeeeme ADHD, she thrives on prototyping early-stage technology and making connections between the disparate web of disciplines & stacks she's accidentally picked up having been mostly glued to a computer since 1996

she wrote her first websites in elementary school in notepad (and distributed them via floppy disk: long story), started writing react the day of the public release, and was working on generative AI design tooling back when AI was in black & white

she's available for part-time/flexible skunkworks projects one last time before the robots take over for good ~ [foo](hireme at jem dot fm)
